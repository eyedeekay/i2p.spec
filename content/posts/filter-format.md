Access Filter Format Specification
==================================

Last updated: April 2019 Accurate for: 0.9.40

Overview
--------

The definition of a filter is a list of Strings. Blank lines and lines
beginning with \# are ignored. Changes in the filter definition take
effect on restart of the tunnel.

Each line can represent one of these items:

-   definition of a default threshold to apply to any remote
    destinations not listed in this file or any of the referenced files
-   definition of a threshold to apply to a specific remote destination
-   definition of a threshold to apply to remote destinations listed in
    a file
-   definition of a threshold that if breached will cause the offending
    remote destination to be recorded in a specified file

The order of the definitions matters. The first threshold for a given
destination (whether explicit or listed in a file) overrides any future
thresholds for the same destination, whether explicit or listed in a
file.

Thresholds
----------

A threshold is defined by the number of connection attempts a remote
destination is permitted to perform over a specified number of seconds
before a \"breach\" occurs. For example the following threshold
definition \"15/5\" means that the same remote destination is allowed to
make 14 connection attempts over a 5 second period, If it makes one more
attempt within the same period, the threshold will be breached.

The threshold format can be one of the following:

-   Numeric definition of number of connections over number seconds -
    \"15/5\", \"30/60\", and so on. Note that if the number of
    connections is 1 (as for example in \"1/1\") the first connection
    attempt will result in a breach.
-   The word \"allow\". This threshold is never breached, i.e. infinite
    number of connection attempts is permitted.
-   The word \"deny\". This threshold is always breached, i.e. no
    connection attempts will be allowed.

### Default Threshold

The default threshold applies to any remote destinations that are not
explicitly listed in the definition or in any of the referenced files.
To set a default threshold use the keyword \"default\". The following
are examples of default thresholds:

    15/5 default
    allow default
    deny default

There can be Only one definition of a default threshold per filter. If
it\'s ommitted, the filter will allow unknown connections by default.

### Explicit Thresholds

Explicit thresholds are applied to a remote destination listed in the
definition itself. Examples:

    15/5 explicit asdfasdfasdf.b32.i2p
    allow explicit fdsafdsafdsa.b32.i2p
    deny explicit qwerqwerqwer.b32.i2p

### Bulk Thresholds

For convenience it is possible to maintain a list of destinations in a
file and define a threshold for all of them in bulk. Examples:

    15/5 file /path/throttled_destinations.txt
    deny file /path/forbidden_destinations.txt
    allow file /path/unlimited_destinations.txt

These files can be edited by hand while the tunnel is running. Changes
to these files may take up to 10 seconds to take effect.

Recorders
---------

Recorders keep track of connection attempts made by a remote
destination, and if that breaches a certain threshold, that destination
gets recorded in a given file. Examples:

    30/5 record /path/aggressive.txt
    60/5 record /path/very_aggressive.txt

It is possible to use a recorder to record aggressive destinations to a
given file, and then use that same file to throttle them. For example,
the following snippet will define a filter that initially allows all
connection attempts, but if any single destination exceeds 30 attempts
per 5 seconds it gets throttled down to 15 attempts per 5 seconds:

    # by default there are no limits
    allow default
    # but record overly aggressive destinations
    30/5 record /path/throttled.txt
    # and any that end up in that file will get throttled in the future
    15/5 file /path/throttled.txt

It is possible to use a recorder in one tunnel that writes to a file
that throttles another tunnel. It is possible to reuse the same file
with destinations in multiple tunnels. And of course, it is possible to
edit these files by hand.

Here is an example filter definition that applies some throttling by
default, no throttling for destinations in the file \"friends.txt\",
forbids any connections from destinations in the file \"enemies.txt\"
and records any aggressive behavior in a file called \"suspicious.txt\":

    15/5 default
    allow file /path/friends.txt
    deny file /path/enemies.txt
    60/5 record /path/suspicious.txt
