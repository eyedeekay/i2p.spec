Plugin Specification
====================

Last updated: November 2019 Accurate for: 0.9.43

Overview
--------

This document specifies a .xpi2p file format (like the Firefox .xpi),
but with a simple plugin.config description file instead of an XML
install.rdf file. This file format is used for both initial plugin
installs and plugin updates.

In addition, this document provides a brief overview of how the router
installs plugins, and policies and guidelines for plugin developers.

The basic .xpi2p file format is the same as a i2pupdate.sud file (the
format used for router updates), but the installer will let the user
install the addon even if it doesn\'t know the signer\'s key yet.

As of release 0.9.15, the SU3 file format \[UPDATES\] is supported and
is preferred. This format enables stronger signing keys.

We do not recommend distributing plugins in the xpi2p format any more.
Use the su3 format.

The standard directory structure will let users install the following
types of addons:

-   console webapps
-   new eepsite with cgi-bin, webapps
-   console themes
-   console translations
-   Java programs
-   Java programs in a separate JVM
-   Any shell script or program

A plugin installs all its files in \~/.i2p/plugins/name/
(%APPDIR%I2Ppluginsnameon Windows). The installer will prevent
installation anywhere else, although the plugin can access libraries
elsewhere when running.

This should be viewed only as a way to make installation,
uninstallation, and upgrading easier, and to lessen basic inter-plugin
conflicts.

There is essentially no security model once the plugin is running,
however. The plugin runs in the same JVM and with the same permissions
as the router, and has full access to the file system, the router,
executing external programs, etc.

Details
-------

foo.xpi2p is a signed update (sud) file \[UPDATES\] containing the
following:

Standard .sud header prepended to the zip file, containing the
following:

    40-byte DSA signature [CRYPTO-DSA] 
    16-byte plugin version in UTF-8, padded with trailing zeroes if necessary

Zip file containing the following:

### plugin.config file

This file is required. It is a standard I2P configuration file
\[CONFIG\], containing the following properties:

The following four are required properties. The first three must be
identical to those in the installed plugin for an update plugin.

> name

Values for the following properties are displayed on /configplugins in
the router console if present:

>
> :   lang xx as of 0.7.12-6

The following optional properties may be used to add a custom icon on
the console:

> console-icon
>
> :   supported as of 0.9.20
>
>     Only for webapps.
>
>     A path within the webapp to a 32x32 image, e.g. /icon.png Applies

The following property is used for translation plugins:

### Application Directories and Files

Each of the following directories or files is optional, but something
must be there or it won\'t do anything:

console/

:   

    locale/

    :   Only jars containing new resource bundles (translations) for
        apps in the base I2P installation. Bundles for this plugin
        should go inside console/webapp/foo.war or lib/foo.jar

    themes/

    :   New themes for the router console Place each theme in a
        subdirectory.

    webapps/

    :   (See important notes below about webapps)

        .wars

        :   These will be run at install time unless disabled in
            webapps.config The war name does not have to be the same as
            the plugin name. Do not duplicate war names in the base I2P
            installation.

    webapps.config

    :   Same format as router\'s webapps.config. Also used to specify
        additional jars in \$PLUGIN/lib/ or \$I2P/lib for the webapp
        classpath, with
        `webapps.warname.classpath=$PLUGIN/lib/foo.jar,$I2P/lib/bar.jar`

        NOTE: Currently, the classpath line is only loaded if the
        warname is the same as the plugin name.

        NOTE: Prior to router version 0.7.12-9, the router looked for
        `plugin.warname.startOnLoad` instead of
        `webapps.warname.startOnLoad`. For compatibility with older
        router versions, a plugin wishing to disable a war should
        include both lines.

eepsite/

:   (See important notes below about eepsites)

    cgi-bin/

    docroot/

    logs/

    webapps/

    jetty.xml

    :   The installer will have to do variable substitution in here to
        set the path. The location and name of this file doesn\'t really
        matter, as long as it is set in clients.config - it may be more
        convenient to be up one level from here (that\'s what the zzzot
        plugin does)

lib/

:   Put any jars here, and specify them in a classpath line in
    console/webapps.config and/or clients.config

### clients.config file

This file is optional, and specifies clients that will be run when a
plugin is started. It uses the same format as the router\'s
clients.config file. See the clients.config configuration file
specification \[CONFIG\] for more information about the format and
important details about how clients are started and stopped.

> property clientApp.0.stopargs=foo bar stop baz
>
> :   If present, the class will be called with these args to stop the
>     client All stop tasks are called with zero delay Note: The router
>     can\'t tell if your unmanaged clients are running or not. Each
>     should handle stopping an app that isn\'t running without
>     complaint. That probably goes for starting a client that is
>     already started too.
>
> property clientApp.0.uninstallargs=foo bar uninstall baz
>
> :   If present, the class will be called with these args just before
>     deleting \$PLUGIN. All uninstall tasks are called with zero delay
>
> property clientApp.0.classpath=\$I2P/lib/foo.bar,\$PLUGIN/lib/bar.jar
>
> :   The plugin runner will do variable substitution in the args and
>     stopargs lines as follows:
>
>     \$I2P
>
>     :   I2P base installation dir
>
>     \$CONFIG
>
>     :   I2P config dir (typically \~/.i2p)
>
>     \$PLUGIN
>
>     :   this plugin\'s installation dir (typically
>         \~/.i2p/plugins/appname)
>
>     (See important notes below about running shell scripts or external
>     programs)

Plugin installer tasks
----------------------

This lists what happens when a plugin is installed by I2P.

-   The .xpi2p file is downloaded.
-   The .sud signature is verified against stored keys. As of release
    0.9.14.1, if there is no matching key, the installation fails,
    unless an advanced router property is set to allow all keys.
-   Verify the integrity of the zip file.
-   Extract the plugin.config file.
-   Verify the I2P version, to make sure the plugin will work.
-   Check that webapps don\'t duplicate the existing \$I2P applications.
-   Stop the existing plugin (if present).
-   Verify that the install directory does not exist yet if
    update=false, or ask to overwrite.
-   Verify that the install directory does exist if update=true, or ask
    to create.
-   Unzip the plugin in to appDir/plugins/name/
-   Add the plugin to plugins.config

Plugin starter tasks
--------------------

This lists what happens when plugins are started. First, plugins.config
is checked to see which plugins need to be started. For each plugin:

-   Check clients.config, and load and start each item (add the
    configured jars to the classpath).
-   Check console/webapp and console/webapp.config. Load and start
    required items (add the configured jars to the classpath).
-   Add console/locale/foo.jar to the translation classpath if present.
-   Add console/theme to the theme search path if present.
-   Add the summary bar link.

Console webapp notes
--------------------

Console webapps with background tasks should implement a
ServletContextListener (see seedless or i2pbote for examples), or
override destroy() in the servlet, so that they can be stopped. As of
router version 0.7.12-3, console webapps will always be stopped before
they are restarted, so you do not need to worry about multiple
instances, as long as you do this. Also as of router version 0.7.12-3,
console webapps will be stopped at router shutdown.

Don\'t bundle library jars in the webapp; put them in lib/ and put a
classpath in webapps.config. Then you can make separate install and
update plugins, where the update plugin does not contain the library
jars.

Never bundle Jetty, Tomcat, or servlet jars in your plugin, as they may
conflict with the version in the I2P installation. Take care not to
bundle any conflicting libraries.

Don\'t include .java or .jsp files; otherwise Jetty will recompile them
at installation, which will increase the startup time. While most I2P
installations will have a working Java and JSP compiler in the
classpath, this is not guaranteed, and may not work in all cases.

For now, a webapp needing to add classpath files in \$PLUGIN must be the
same name as the plugin. For example, a webapp in plugin foo must be
named foo.war.

While I2P has supported Servlet 3.0 since I2P release 0.9.30, it does
NOT support annotation scanning for \@WebContent (no web.xml file).
Several additional runtime jars would be required, and we do not provide
those in a standard installation. Contact the I2P developers if you need
support for \@WebContent.

Eepsite notes
-------------

It isn\'t clear how to have a plugin install to an existing eepsite. The
router has no hook to the eepsite, and it may or may not be running, and
there may be more than one. Better is to start your own Jetty instance
and I2PTunnel instance, for a brand new eepsite.

It can instantiate a new I2PTunnel (somewhat like the i2ptunnel CLI
does), but it won\'t appear in the i2ptunnel gui of course, that\'s a
different instance. But that\'s ok. Then you can start and stop
i2ptunnel and jetty together.

So don\'t count on the router to automatically merge this with some
existing eepsite. It probably won\'t happen. Start a new I2PTunnel and
Jetty from clients.config. The best examples of this are the zzzot and
pebble plugins, available at zzz\'s plugins page \[STATS-PLUGINS\].

How to get path substitution into jetty.xml? See zzzot and pebble
plugins for examples.

Client start/stop notes
-----------------------

As of release 0.9.4, the router supports \"managed\" plugin clients.
Managed plugin clients are instantiated and started by the
`ClientAppManager`. The ClientAppManager maintains a reference to the
client and receives updates on the client\'s state. Managed plugin
client are preferred, as it is much easier to implement state tracking
and to start and stop a client. It also is much easier to avoid static
references in the client code which could lead to excessive memory usage
after a client is stopped. See the clients.config configuration file
specification \[CONFIG\] for more information on writing a managed
client.

For \"unmanaged\" plugin clients, The router has no way to monitor the
state of clients started via clients.config. The plugin author should
handle multiple start or stop calls gracefully, if at all possible, by
keeping a static state table, or using PID files, etc. Avoid logging or
exceptions on multiple starts or stops. This also goes for a stop call
without a previous start. As of router version 0.7.12-3, plugins will be
stopped at router shutdown, which means that all clients with stopargs
in clients.config will be called, whether or not they were previously
started.

Shell script and external program notes
---------------------------------------

To run shell scripts or other external programs, see \[ZZZ-141\].

To work on both Windows and Linux, write a small Java class that checks
the OS type, then runs ShellCommand on either the .bat or a .sh file you
provide.

External programs won\'t be stopped when the router stops, and a second
copy will fire up when the router starts. To work around this, you could
write a wrapper class or shell script that does the usual storage of the
PID in a PID file, and check for it on start.

Other plugin guidelines
-----------------------

-   See i2p.scripts monotone branch or any of the sample plugins on
    zzz\'s page for the makeplugin.sh shell script. This automates most
    of the tasks for key generation, plugin su3 file creation, and
    verification. You should incorporate this script into your plugin
    build process.
-   Pack200 of jars and wars is strongly recommended for plugins, it
    generally shrinks plugins by 60-65&\#37;. See any of the sample
    plugins on zzz\'s page for an example. Pack200 unpacking is
    supported on routers 0.7.11-5 or higher, which is essentially all
    routers that support plugins at all.
-   Plugins must not attempt to write anywhere in \$I2P as it may be
    readonly, and that isn\'t good policy anyway.
-   Plugins may write to \$CONFIG but keeping files in \$PLUGIN only is
    recommended. All files in \$PLUGIN will be deleted at uninstall.
    Files elsewhere will not be deleted at uninstall unless the plugin
    does it explicitly with a client in clients.config run with
    uninstallargs. If the user may want to save data after
    uninstallation, the uninstallargs hook could ask.
-   \$CWD may be anywhere; do not assume it is in a particular place, do
    not attempt to read or write files relative to \$CWD.
-   Java programs should find out where they are with the directory
    getters in I2PAppContext.
-   Plugin directory is
    `I2PAppContext.getGlobalContext().getAppDir().getAbsolutePath() + "/plugins/" + appname`,
    or put a \$PLUGIN argument in the args line in clients.config. There
    is no reliable way to find the i2p install or config or plugin
    directory without using the context API in i2p.jar.
-   See \[ZZZ-16\] for info on generating signing keys and
    generating/verifying keys and sud files.
-   See \[ZZZ-1473\] for info on generating signing keys and
    generating/verifying keys for su3 files.
-   All config files must be UTF-8.
-   To run in a separate JVM, use ShellCommand with
    `java -cp foo:bar:baz my.main.class arg1 arg2 arg3`. Of course, it
    will be a lot harder to stop the plugin then\... But with some
    trickery with PID files it should be possible.
-   As an alternative to stopargs in clients.config, a Java client may
    register a shutdown hook with I2PAppContext.addShutdownTask(). But
    this wouldn\'t shut down a plugin when upgrading, so stopargs is
    recommended. Also, set all created threads to daemon mode.
-   Do not include classes duplicating those in the standard
    installation. Extend the classes if necessary.
-   Beware of the different classpath definitions in wrapper.config
    between old and new installations - see classpath section below.
-   Clients will reject duplicate keys with different keynames, and
    duplicate keynames with different keys, and different keys or
    keynames in upgrade packages. Safeguard your keys. Only generate
    them once.
-   Do not modify the plugin.config file at runtime as it will be
    overwritten on upgrade. Use a different config file in the directory
    for storing runtime configuration.
-   In general, plugins should not require access to
    \$I2P/lib/router.jar. Do not access router classes, unless you are
    doing something special. The router may in the future implement a
    restricted classpath for plugins that prevents access to router
    classes.
-   Since each version must be higher than the one before, you could
    enhance your build script to add a build number to the end of the
    version. This helps for testing. Most of zzz\'s plugins have that
    feature, check build.xml for an example.
-   Plugins must never call `System.exit()`.
-   Please respect licenses by meeting license requirements for any
    software you bundle.
-   The router sets the JVM time zone to UTC. If a plugin needs to know
    the user\'s actual time zone, it is stored by the router in the
    I2PAppContext property `i2p.systemTimeZone`.

Classpaths
----------

The following jars in \$I2P/lib can be assumed to be in the standard
classpath for all I2P installations, no matter how old or how new the
original installation.

All recent public APIs in i2p jars have the since-release number
specified in the Javadocs. For bundled jars, see the API guidelines
below. If your plugin requires certain features only available in recent
versions, be sure to set the properties min-i2p-version,
min-jetty-version, or both, in the plugin.config file. This will give
your users a clear error message on installation if the requirements are
not met.

The following jars in \$I2P/lib can be assumed to be present for all I2P
installations, no matter how old or how new the original installation,
but are not necessarily in the classpath:

  Jar            Contains          Usage
  -------------- ----------------- ----------------------------
  jstl.jar       Standard Taglib   For plugins using JSP tags
  standard.jar   Standard Taglib   For plugins using JSP tags

Anything not listed above may not be present in everybody\'s classpath,
even if you have it in the classpath in YOUR version of i2p. If you need
any jar not listed above, add \$I2P/lib/foo.jar to the classpath
specified in clients.config or webapps.config in your plugin.

Previously, a classpath entry specified in clients.config was added to
the classpath for the entire JVM. However, as of 0.7.13-3, this was
fixed using class loaders, and now, as originally intended, the
specified classpath in clients.config is only for the particular thread.
See the section on JVM crashes below, and \[ZZZ-633\] for background.
Therefore, specify the full required classpath for each client.

Java Version Notes
------------------

I2P has required Java 7 since release 0.9.24 (January 2016). I2P has
required Java 6 since release 0.9.12 (April 2014). Any I2P users on the
latest release should be running a 1.7 (7.0) JVM. In early 2016, unless
you require 1.7 language or library features, you should create your
plugin so it works on 1.6. Later in the year, most of the network will
be on 0.9.24 or higher with Java 7.

If your plugin **does not require 1.7**:

-   Ensure that all java and jsp files are compiled with source=\"1.6\"
    target=\"1.6\".
-   Ensure that all bundled library jars are also for 1.6 or lower.

If your plugin **requires 1.7**:

-   Note that on your download page.
-   Add min-java-version=1.7 to your plugin.config

In any case, you **must** set a bootclasspath when compiling with Java 8
to prevent runtime crashes.

JVM Crashes When Updating
-------------------------

Note - this should all be fixed now.

The JVM has a tendency to crash when updating jars in a plugin if that
plugin was running since I2P was started (even if the plugin was later
stopped). This may have been fixed with the class loader implementation
in 0.7.13-3, but it may not. For further testing.

The safest is to design your plugin with the jar inside the war (for a
webapp), or to require a restart after update, or don\'t update the jars
in your plugin.

Due to the way class loaders work inside a webapp, it \_[may]() be safe
to have external jars if you specify the classpath in webapps.config.
More testing is required to verify this. Don\'t specify the classpath
with a \'fake\' client in clients.config if it\'s only needed for a
webapp - use webapps.config instead.

The least safe, and apparently the source of most crashes, is clients
with plugin jars specified in the classpath in clients.config.

None of this should be a problem on initial install - you should not
ever have to require a restart for an initial install of a plugin.
