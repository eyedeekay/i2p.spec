B32 for Encrypted Leasesets
===========================

Last updated: 2020-08 Accurate for: 0.9.47

Overview
--------

Standard Base 32 (\"b32\") addresses contain the hash of the
destination. This will not work for encrypted ls2 (proposal 123).

We can\'t use a traditional base 32 address for an encrypted LS2
(proposal 123), as it contains only the hash of the destination. It does
not provide the non-blinded public key. Clients must know the
destination\'s public key, sig type, the blinded sig type, and an
optional secret or private key to fetch and decrypt the leaseset.
Therefore, a base 32 address alone is insufficient. The client needs
either the full destination (which contains the public key), or the
public key by itself. If the client has the full destination in an
address book, and the address book supports reverse lookup by hash, then
the public key may be retrieved.

This format puts the public key instead of the hash into a base32
address. This format must also contain the signature type of the public
key, and the signature type of the blinding scheme.

This document specifies a b32 format for these addresses. While we have
referred to this new format during discussions as a \"b33\" address, the
actual new format retains the usual \".b32.i2p\" suffix.

Design
------

-   New format will contain the unblinded public key, unblinded sig
    type, and blinded sig type.
-   Optionally contain a secret and/or private key, for private links
    only
-   Use the existing \".b32.i2p\" suffix, but with a longer length.
-   Add a checksum.
-   Addresses for encrypted leasesets are identified by 56 or more
    encoded characters (35 or more decoded bytes), compared to 52
    characters (32 bytes) for traditional base 32 addresses.

Specification
-------------

### Creation and encoding

Construct a hostname of {56+ chars}.b32.i2p (35+ chars in binary) as
follows:

> flag (1 byte)
>
> :   bit 0: 0 for one-byte sigtypes, 1 for two-byte sigtypes bit 1: 0
>     for no secret, 1 if secret is required bit 2: 0 for no per-client
>     auth, 1 if client private key is required bits 7-3: Unused, set to
>     0
>
> public key sigtype (1 or 2 bytes as indicated in flags)
>
> :   If 1 byte, the upper byte is assumed zero
>
> blinded key sigtype (1 or 2 bytes as indicated in flags)
>
> :   If 1 byte, the upper byte is assumed zero
>
> public key
>
> :   Number of bytes as implied by sigtype

Post-processing and checksum:

> Construct the binary data as above. Treat checksum as little-endian.
> Calculate checksum = CRC-32(data\[3:end\]) data\[0\] \^= (byte)
> checksum data\[1\] \^= (byte) (checksum \>\> 8) data\[2\] \^= (byte)
> (checksum \>\> 16)
>
> hostname = Base32.encode(data) \|\| \".b32.i2p\"

Any unused bits at the end of the b32 must be 0. There are no unused
bits for a standard 56 character (35 byte) address.

### Decoding and Verification

> strip the \".b32.i2p\" from the hostname data =
> Base32.decode(hostname) Calculate checksum = CRC-32(data\[3:end\])
> Treat checksum as little-endian. flags = data\[0\] \^ (byte) checksum
> if 1 byte sigtypes: pubkey sigtype = data\[1\] \^ (byte) (checksum
> \>\> 8) blinded sigtype = data\[2\] \^ (byte) (checksum \>\> 16) else
> (2 byte sigtypes) : pubkey sigtype = data\[1\] \^ ((byte) (checksum
> \>\> 8)) \|\| data\[2\] \^ ((byte) (checksum \>\> 16)) blinded sigtype
> = data\[3\] \|\| data\[4\] parse the remainder based on the flags to
> get the public key

### Secret and Private Key Bits

The secret and private key bits are used to indicate to clients,
proxies, or other client-side code that the secret and/or private key
will be required to decrypt the leaseset. Particular implementations may
prompt the user to supply the required data, or reject connection
attempts if the required data is missing.

Caching
-------

While outside the scope of this specification, routers and/or clients
must remember and cache (probably persistently) the mapping of public
key to destination, and vice versa.

Notes
-----

-   Distinguish old from new flavors by length. Old b32 addresses are
    always {52 chars}.b32.i2p. New ones are {56+ chars}.b32.i2p
-   Tor discussion thread:
    <https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2017-January/011816.html>
-   Don\'t expect 2-byte sigtypes to ever happen, we\'re only up to 13.
    No need to implement now.
-   New format can be used in jump links (and served by jump servers) if
    desired, just like b32.
