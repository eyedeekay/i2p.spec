Low-level Cryptography Specification
====================================

Category: Design Last updated: 2020-09 Accurate for: 0.9.47

Overview
--------

This page specifies the low-level details of the cryptography in I2P.

There are several cryptographic algorithms in use within I2P. In I2P\'s
original design, there was only one of each type - one symmetric
algorithm, one asymmetric algorithm, one signing algorithm, and one
hashing algorithm. There was no provision to add more algorithms or
migrate to ones with more security.

In recent years we have added a framework to support multiple primitives
and combinations in a backward-compatible way. Numerous signature
algorithms, with varying key and signature lengths, are defined by
\"signature types\". End-to-end encryption schemes, using a combination
of asymmetric and symmetric encryption, and with varying key lengths,
are defined by \"encryption types\".

Various protocols and data structures in I2P include fields to specify
the signature type and/or encryption type. These fields, together with
the type definitions, define the key and signature lengths and the
cryptographic primitives required to use them. The definitions of the
signature and encryption types is in the Common Structures specification
\[Common\].

The original I2P protocols NTCP, SSU, and ElGamal/AES+SessionTags use a
combination of ElGamal asymmetric encryption and AES symmetric
encryption. Newer protocols NTCP2 and ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet use a
combination of X25519 key exchange and ChaCha20/Poly1305 symmetric
encryption.

-   NTCP2 has replaced NTCP.
-   ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet design and implementation are complete,
    and will replace ElGamal/AES+SessionTags in late 2020.
-   SSU2, using X25519 and ChaCha20/Poly1305, is scheduled for design in
    late 2020 to replace SSU in 2021.

Asymmetric Encryption
---------------------

The original asymmetric encryption algorithm in I2P is ElGamal. The
newer algorithm, used in several places, is ECIES X25519 DH key
exchange.

We are in the process of migrating all ElGamal usage to X25519.

NTCP (with ElGamal) was migrated to NTCP2 (with X25519).
ElGamal/AES+SessionTag is being migrated to ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet.

### X25519

For the details of X25519 usage see \[NTCP2\] and \[ECIES\].

### ElGamal

ElGamal is used in several places in I2P:

-   To encrypt router-to-router \[TunnelBuild\] messages
-   For end-to-end (destination-to-destination) encryption as a part of
    ElGamal/AES+SessionTag \[ELG-AES\] using the encryption key in the
    \[LeaseSet\]
-   For encryption of some netDb stores and queries sent to floodfill
    routers \[NETDB-DELIVERY\] as a part of ElGamal/AES+SessionTag
    \[ELG-AES\] (destination-to-router or router-to-router).

We use common primes for 2048 ElGamal encryption and decryption, as
given by IETF \[RFC-3526\]. We currently only use ElGamal to encrypt the
IV and session key in a single block, followed by the AES encrypted
payload using that key and IV.

The unencrypted ElGamal contains:

> +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+
> H(data) \| +\-\-\--+ + \| \| + + \| \| + + \| \| +
> +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| \|
> data\... +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+-//

The H(data) is the SHA256 of the data that is encrypted in the ElGamal
block, and is preceded by a random nonzero byte. This byte is actually
random as of 0.9.28; prior to that it was always 0xFF. It could possibly
be used for flags in the future. The data encrypted in the block may be
up to 222 bytes long. As the encrypted data may contain a substantial
number of zeros if the cleartext is smaller than 222 bytes, it is
recommended that higher layers pad the cleartext to 222 bytes with
random data. Total length: typically 255 bytes.

The encrypted ElGamal contains:

> +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \|
> zero padding\... \| \| +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+-//-+\-\-\--+ + \| \|
> + + \| ElG encrypted part 1 \| \~ \~ \| \| +
> +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| \| zero
> padding\... \| \| +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+-//-+\-\-\--+ + \|
> \| + + \| ElG encrypted part 2 \| \~ \~ \| \| +
> +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+\-\-\--+ \| +
> +\-\-\--+\-\-\--+

Each encrypted part is prepended with zeros to a size of exactly 257
bytes. Total length: 514 bytes. In typical usage, higher layers pad the
cleartext data to 222 bytes, resulting in an unencrypted block of 255
bytes. This is encoded as two 256-byte encrypted parts, and there is a
single byte of zero padding before each part at this layer.

See the ElGamal code \[ElGamalEngine\].

The shared prime is the Oakley prime for 2048 bit keys \[RFC-3526-S3\] :

    2^2048 - 2^1984 - 1 + 2^64 * { [2^1918 pi] + 124476 }

or as a hexadecimal value:

    FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF C90FDAA2 2168C234 C4C6628B 80DC1CD1

Using 2 as the generator.

#### Short Exponent {#exponent}

While the standard exponent size is 2048 bits (256 bytes) and the I2P
\[PrivateKey\] is a full 256 bytes, in some cases we use the short
exponent size of 226 bits (28.25 bytes). This should be safe for use
with the Oakley primes \[vanOorschot1996\] \[BENCHMARKS\].

Also, \[Koshiba2004\] apparently supports this, according to this
sci.crypt thread \[SCI.CRYPT\]. The remainder of the PrivateKey is
padded with zeroes.

Prior to release 0.9.8, all routers used the short exponent. As of
release 0.9.8, 64-bit x86 routers use a full 2048-bit exponent. All
router now use the full exponent except for a small number of routers on
very slow hardware, who continue to use the short exponent due to
concerns about processor load. The transition to a longer exponent for
these platforms is a topic for further study.

#### Obsolescence

The vulnerability of the network to an ElGamal attack and the impact of
transitioning to a longer bit length is to be studied. It may be quite
difficult to make any change backward-compatible.

Symmetric Encryption
--------------------

The original symmetric encryption algorithm in I2P is AES. The newer
algorithm, used in several places, is Autheticated Encryption with
Associated Data (AEAD) ChaCha20/Poly1305.

We are in the process of migrating all AES usage to ChaCha20/Poly1305.

NTCP (with AES) was migrated to NTCP2 (with ChaCha20/Poly1305).
ElGamal/AES+SessionTag is being migrated to ECIES-X25519-AEAD-Ratchet.

### ChaCha20/Poly1305

For the details of ChaCha20/Poly1305 usage see \[NTCP2\] and \[ECIES\].

### AES

AES is used for symmetric encryption, in several cases:

-   For SSU transport encryption (see section
    \"[Transports](#transports)\") after DH key exchange
-   For end-to-end (destination-to-destination) encryption as a part of
    ElGamal/AES+SessionTag \[ELG-AES\]
-   For encryption of some netDb stores and queries sent to floodfill
    routers \[NETDB-DELIVERY\] as a part of ElGamal/AES+SessionTag
    \[ELG-AES\] (destination-to-router or router-to-router).
-   For encryption of periodic tunnel test messages \[TUNNEL-TESTING\]
    sent from the router to itself, through its own tunnels.

We use AES with 256 bit keys and 128 bit blocks in CBC mode. The padding
used is specified in IETF \[RFC-2313\] (PKCS\#5 1.5, section 8.1 (for
block type 02)). In this case, padding exists of pseudorandomly
generated octets to match 16 byte blocks. Specifically, see the CBC code
\[CryptixAESEngine\] and the Cryptix AES implementation
\[CryptixRijndael\_Algorithm\], as well as the padding, found in the
ElGamalAESEngine.getPadding function \[ElGamalAESEngine\].

#### Obsolescence

The vulnerability of the network to an AES attack and the impact of
transitioning to a longer bit length is to be studied. It may be quite
difficult to make any change backward-compatible.

Signatures {#sig}
----------

Numerous signature algorithms, with varying key and signature lengths,
are defined by signature types. It is relatively easy to add more
signature types.

EdDSA-SHA512-Ed25519 is the current default signature algorithm. DSA,
which was the original algorithm before we added support for signature
types, is still in use in the network.

### DSA

Signatures are generated and verified with 1024 bit \[DSA\] (L=1024,
N=160), as implemented in \[DSAEngine\]. DSA was chosen because it is
much faster for signatures than ElGamal.

#### SEED

160 bit:

    3E93BE47 08CBCC82

The \[SigningPublicKey\] is 1024 bits. The \[SigningPrivateKey\] is 160
bits.

#### Obsolescence

\[NIST-800-57\] recommends a minimum of (L=2048, N=224) for usage beyond
2010. This may be mitigated somewhat by the \"cryptoperiod\", or
lifespan of a given key.

The prime number was chosen in 2003 \[CHOOSING-CONSTANTS\], and the
person that chose the number (TheCrypto) is currently no longer an I2P
developer. As such, we do not know if the prime chosen is a \'strong
prime\'. If a larger prime is chosen for future purposes, this should be
a strong prime, and we will document the construction process.

New Signature Algorithms
------------------------

As of release 0.9.12, the router supports additional signature
algorithms that are more secure than 1024-bit DSA. The first usage was
for Destinations; support for Router Identities was added in release
0.9.16. Existing Destinations cannot be migrated from old to new
signatures; however, there is support for a single tunnel with multiple
Destinations, and this provides a way to switch to newer signature
types. Signature type is encoded in the Destination and Router Identity,
so that new signature algorithms or curves may be added at any time.

The current supported signature types are as follows:

-   DSA-SHA1
-   ECDSA-SHA256-P256
-   ECDSA-SHA384-P384 (not widely used)
-   ECDSA-SHA512-P521 (not widely used)
-   EdDSA-SHA512-Ed25519 (default as of release 0.9.15)
-   RedDSA-SHA512-Ed25519 (as of release 0.9.39)

Additional signature types are used at the application layer only,
primarily for signing and verifying su3 files. These signature types are
as follows:

-   RSA-SHA256-2048 (not widely used)
-   RSA-SHA384-3072 (not widely used)
-   RSA-SHA512-4096
-   EdDSA-SHA512-Ed25519ph (as of release 0.9.25; not widely used)

### ECDSA

ECDSA uses the standard NIST curves and standard SHA-2 hashes.

We migrated new destinations to ECDSA-SHA256-P256 in the 0.9.16 - 0.9.19
release time frame. Usage for Router Identities is supported as of
release 0.9.16 and migration of existing routers happened in 2015.

### RSA

Standard RSA PKCS\#1 v1.5 (RFC 2313) with the public exponent F4 =
65537.

RSA is now used for signing all out-of-band trusted content, including
router updates, reseeding, plugins, and news. The signatures are
embedded in the \"su3\" format \[UPDATES\]. 4096-bit keys are
recommended and used by all known signers. RSA is not used, or planned
for use, in any in-network Destinations or Router Identities.

### EdDSA 25519

Standard EdDSA using curve 25519 and standard 512-bit SHA-2 hashes.

Supported as of release 0.9.15.

Destinations and Router Identities were migrated in late 2015.

### RedDSA 25519

Standard EdDSA using curve 25519 and standard 512-bit SHA-2 hashes, but
with different private keys, and minor modifications to signing. For
encrypted leasesets. See \[EncryptedLeaseSet\] and \[Red25519\] for
details.

Supported as of release 0.9.39.

Hashes
------

Hashes are used in signature algorithms and as keys in the network\'s
DHT.

Older signature algorithms use SHA1 and SHA256. Newer signature
algorithms use SHA512. The DHT uses SHA256.

### SHA256

DHT hashes within I2P are standard SHA256.

#### Obsolescence

The vulnerability of the network to a SHA-256 attack and the impact of
transitioning to a longer hash is to be studied. It may be quite
difficult to make any change backward-compatible.

Transports
----------

At the lowest protocol layer, point-to-point inter-router communication
is protected by the transport layer security.

NTCP2 connections use X25519 Diffie-Hellman and ChaCha20/Poly1305
authenticated encryption.

SSU and the obsolete NTCP transports use 256 byte (2048 bit)
Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the same shared prime and generator as
specified above for [ElGamal](#elgamal), followed by symmetric AES
encryption as described above.

SSU is planned to be migrated to SSU2 (with X25519 and
ChaCha20/Poly1305).

All transports provide perfect forward secrecy \[PFS\] on the transport
links.

### NTCP2 connections {#tcp}

NTCP2 connections use X25519 Diffie-Hellman and ChaCha20/Poly1305
authenticated encryption, and the Noise protocol framework \[Noise\].

See the NTCP2 specification \[NTCP2\] for details and references.

### UDP connections {#udp}

SSU (the UDP transport) encrypts each packet with AES256/CBC with both
an explicit IV and MAC (HMAC-MD5-128) after agreeing upon an ephemeral
session key through a 2048 bit Diffie-Hellman exchange,
station-to-station authentication with the other router\'s DSA key, plus
each network message has their own hash for local integrity checking.

See the SSU specification \[SSU-KEYS\] for details.

WARNING - I2P\'s HMAC-MD5-128 used in SSU is apparently non-standard.
Apparently, an early version of SSU used HMAC-SHA256, and then it was
switched to MD5-128 for performance reasons, but left the 32-byte buffer
size intact. See HMACGenerator.java and the 2005-07-05 status notes
\[STATUS-HMAC\] for details.

### NTCP connections

NTCP is no longer used, it was replaced by NTCP2.

NTCP connections were negotiated with a 2048 Diffie-Hellman
implementation, using the router\'s identity to proceed with a station
to station agreement, followed by some encrypted protocol specific
fields, with all subsequent data encrypted with AES (as above). The
primary reason to do the DH negotiation instead of using
ElGamalAES+SessionTag \[ELG-AES\] is that it provides \'(perfect)
forward secrecy\' \[PFS\], while ElGamalAES+SessionTag does not.

See the NTCP specification \[NTCP\] for details.
