<p>See [STREAMING] for an overview of the Streaming Library.</p>
<h2 id="versions">Protocol Versions</h2>
<p>The streaming protocol does not include a version field. The versions
listed below are for Java I2P. Implementations and actual crypto support
may vary. There is no way to determine if the far-end supports any
particular version or feature. The table below is for general guidance
as to the release dates for various features.</p>
<p>The features listed below are for the protocol itself. Various options
for configuration are documented in [STREAMING] along with the Java
I2P version in which they were implemented.</p>

<h3 id="packet-format">Packet Format</h3>
<p>The format of a single packet in the streaming protocol is shown below.
The minimum header size, without NACKs or option data, is 22 bytes.</p>
<p>There is no length field in the streaming protocol. Framing is provided
by the lower layers - I2CP and I2NP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ |
send Stream ID | rcv Stream ID |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ |
sequence Num | ack Through |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ |
nc | nc*4 bytes of NACKs (optional)
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ |
rd | flags | opt size| opt data
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ ...
(optional, see below) |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+ |
payload ... +----+----+----+-//</p>
<dl>
<dt>sendStreamId :: 4 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>Random number selected by the packet recipient before sending the
first SYN reply packet and constant for the life of the
connection. 0 in the SYN message sent by the connection
originator, and in subsequent messages, until a SYN reply is
received, containing the peer's stream ID.</dd>
<dt>receiveStreamId :: 4 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>Random number selected by the packet originator before sending the
first SYN packet and constant for the life of the connection. May
be 0 if unknown, for example in a RESET packet.</dd>
<dt>sequenceNum :: 4 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>The sequence for this message, starting at 0 in the SYN message,
and incremented by 1 in each message except for plain ACKs and
retransmissions. If the sequenceNum is 0 and the SYN flag is not
set, this is a plain ACK packet that should not be ACKed.</dd>
<dt>ackThrough :: 4 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>The highest packet sequence number that was received on the
$receiveStreamId. This field is ignored on the initial connection
packet (where $receiveStreamId is the unknown id) or if the
NO_ACK flag set. All packets up to and including this sequence
number are ACKed, EXCEPT for those listed in NACKs below.</dd>
<dt>NACK count :: 1 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>The number of 4-byte NACKs in the next field</dd>
<dt>NACKs :: $nc * 4 byte [Integer]s</dt>
<dd>Sequence numbers less than ackThrough that are not yet received.
Two NACKs of a packet is a request for a 'fast retransmit' of
that packet.</dd>
<dt>resendDelay :: 1 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>How long is the creator of this packet going to wait before
resending this packet (if it hasn't yet been ACKed). The value is
seconds since the packet was created. Currently ignored on
receive.</dd>
<dt>flags :: 2 byte value</dt>
<dd>See below.</dd>
<dt>option size :: 2 byte [Integer]</dt>
<dd>The number of bytes in the next field</dd>
<dt>option data :: 0 or more bytes</dt>
<dd>As specified by the flags. See below.</dd>
</dl>
<p>payload :: remaining packet size</p>

<h3 id="flags-and-option-data-fields">Flags and Option Data Fields</h3>
<p>The flags field above specifies some metadata about the packet, and in
turn may require certain additional data to be included. The flags are
as follows. Any data structures specified must be added to the options
area in the given order.</p>
<p>Bit order: 15.&hellip;0 (15 is MSB)</p>

<h4 id="variable-length-signature-notes">Variable Length Signature Notes</h4>
<p>Prior to release 0.9.11, the signature in the option field was always 40
bytes.</p>
<p>As of release 0.9.11, the signature is variable length. The Signature
type and length are inferred from the type of key used in the
FROM_INCLUDED option and the [Signature] documentation.</p>
<p>As of release 0.9.39, the OFFLINE_SIGNATURE option is supported. If
this option is present, the transient [SigningPublicKey] is used to
verify any signed packets, and the signature length and type are
inferred from the transient [SigningPublicKey] in the option.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a packet contains both FROM_INCLUDED and SIGNATURE_INCLUDED
(as in SYNCHRONIZE), the inference may be made directly.</li>
<li>When a packet does not contain FROM_INCLUDED, the inference must be
made from a previous SYNCHRONIZE packet.</li>
<li>When a packet does not contain FROM_INCLUDED, and there was no
previous SYNCHRONIZE packet (for example a stray CLOSE or RESET
packet), the inference can be made from the length of the remaining
options (since SIGNATURE_INCLUDED is the last option), but the
packet will probably be discarded anyway, since there is no FROM
available to validate the signature. If more option fields are
defined in the future, they must be accounted for.</li>
</ul>
